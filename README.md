Comparing the Three Bucket Strategy to the more simple Total Portfolio Rebalance Strategy


Alright, let's dive into the rebalancing magic for the Total Return strategy! It's actually quite straightforward once you see it step-by-step. Imagine you're a diligent portfolio manager for yourself, and at the end of each year, you want to make sure your investments are still in the right proportions.

Here's the part of the code in simulateTotalReturnStrategy_Detailed that handles this annual check-up and adjustment:

// SCENE: This happens at the end of each simulated year,
// AFTER your money has been withdrawn for living expenses,
// AND AFTER your stocks and bonds have grown (or shrunk) based on market returns.

// Initialize a couple of notes in our logbook for this year.
// We'll write down how much stock and bond we *actually* bought or sold during rebalancing.
// For now, we assume we haven't bought/sold anything for rebalancing yet, so they are zero.
logEntry.rebalanceStockAmount = 0;
logEntry.rebalanceBondAmount = 0;

// First, a common-sense check: Is there any money left in the portfolio?
// If the portfolio balance is zero (or less, which shouldn't happen but good to be safe),
// there's nothing to rebalance! So, we only do the next steps if there's money.
if (portfolioBalance > 0) {

    // GOAL: We want our stocks to be, say, 60% of our total money,
    // and bonds to be 40%. This is our "target allocation".
    // `params.trStockAllocationRatio` holds our desired stock percentage (e.g., 0.60 for 60%).

    // Step 1: Calculate the IDEAL dollar amount we *should* have in stocks.
    // We take our current total portfolio value (`portfolioBalance`)
    // and multiply it by our target stock percentage.
    // Example: If portfolio is $100,000 and stock target is 60% (0.60),
    // then targetStock = $100,000 * 0.60 = $60,000.
    // This is the dream amount for stocks.
    const targetStock = portfolioBalance * params.trStockAllocationRatio;

    // Step 2: Calculate the IDEAL dollar amount we *should* have in bonds.
    // If stocks are 60%, then bonds must be 100% - 60% = 40%.
    // So, `(1 - params.trStockAllocationRatio)` gives us the bond percentage (e.g., 1 - 0.60 = 0.40).
    // Example: targetBond = $100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000.
    // This is the dream amount for bonds.
    const targetBond = portfolioBalance * (1 - params.trStockAllocationRatio);

    // Step 3: Figure out how much stock we need to BUY or SELL to hit our target.
    // We compare our `targetStock` (what we want) with our `stockBalance` (what we currently have
    // after this year's market movements).
    // - If targetStock is $60,000 and we only have $55,000 in stockBalance (maybe stocks didn't grow as much),
    //   then $60,000 - $55,000 = +$5,000. We need to BUY $5,000 worth of stock.
    // - If targetStock is $60,000 but we have $65,000 in stockBalance (maybe stocks grew a lot!),
    //   then $60,000 - $65,000 = -$5,000. We need to SELL $5,000 worth of stock.
    // We record this buy/sell amount in our logbook.
    logEntry.rebalanceStockAmount = targetStock - stockBalance;

    // Step 4: Do the same for bonds.
    // Figure out how much bond we need to BUY or SELL.
    // - If targetBond is $40,000 and we have $45,000 in bondBalance,
    //   then $40,000 - $45,000 = -$5,000. We need to SELL $5,000 of bonds.
    //   (This makes sense: if we're buying stock, we often sell bonds to get the cash, and vice-versa).
    // We record this in our logbook.
    logEntry.rebalanceBondAmount = targetBond - bondBalance;

    // Step 5: THE ACTUAL REBALANCE (in the simulation's world)
    // Now that we know our targets, we simply update our current balances to match these targets.
    // It's like the simulation magically makes the trades happen.
    // Our `stockBalance` is now officially set to the `targetStock` amount.
    stockBalance = targetStock;

    // And our `bondBalance` is now officially set to the `targetBond` amount.
    bondBalance = targetBond;

    // And that's it! Our portfolio is now perfectly back to our desired 60/40 (or whatever) split.
    // We've "taken profits" from the asset that did well and "bought the dip" in the asset that did less well,
    // bringing everything back in line.
}
// If the `if (portfolioBalance > 0)` was false, all these steps are skipped.
